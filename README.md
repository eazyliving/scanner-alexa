# scanner-alexa

A bunch of configuration and bash scripts to use fauxmo (https://github.com/n8henrie/fauxmo) and sane/airscan to use alexa for starting a scanner.
I use this for my document management. And sicne I'm lazy (and the scanner has no option to scan to ftp/samba) fauxmo/alexa triggers a scan just into paperless-ng.
